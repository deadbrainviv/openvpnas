Here's a robust and secure shell script that automates installing OpenVPN and deploying a simple web-based administration interface (using the widely-used OpenVPN management platform OpenVPN Access Server):

Script Overview:

Installs OpenVPN Access Server (with web UI) on Ubuntu.

Configures the admin user and password.

Adjusts firewall settings for accessibility.

Suitable for both local and AWS EC2 Ubuntu instances.

chmod +x install_openvpn_web.sh
Run the script with root privileges:

sudo ./install_openvpn_web.sh
After Installation:

Access your web-based administration panel using:

https://your_static_ip:943

Use the provided admin credentials to log in initially and manage your VPN clients and settings.

Security Recommendations:

Immediately change the ADMIN_PASS in the script to a strong, secure, and unique password before running.
Ensure your firewall (UFW or AWS Security Groups) restricts access to known trusted IP addresses for increased security.
